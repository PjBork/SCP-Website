    <h2>Item #: SCP-2316</h2>
    <h2>Object Class: Keter</h2>
    <h2>Special Containment Procedures:</h2> Under no circumstances are Foundation personnel to approach SCP-2316. Observation of SCP-2316 must only be carried out by remote dummy probes utilizing video and audio recording equipment. Only those personnel adequately rated for exposure to cognitohazardous anomalies may review footage and audio of SCP-2316.
    <br><br>
    The lake in which SCP-2316 is located has been quarantined and fenced off, and is to be routinely patrolled by individuals who have not been exposed to SCP-2316, and have no prior knowledge of its characteristics. You do not recognize the bodies in the water. Individuals who attempt to bypass the enforced quarantine must be apprehended and moved to Site-33 for a full cognitive influence screening. Individuals who come within 50m of the lake containing SCP-2316 are to be considered lost.

    <h2>Description:</h2> SCP-2316 is the designation for an anomalous phenomenon existing within Lake ███████████ within ████████ County, ███████. SCP-2316 manifests as a group of human corpses1 floating in a small group at the surface of the water. The identities of these corpses are [COGNITOHAZARD REMOVED] [Automated Change: UNKNOWN], though DNA testing has been inconclusive.
    <br><br>
    While SCP-2316 appears to be individual instances, it is theorized that SCP-2316 may instead be an entity composed of a collective consciousness. Individual instances of SCP-2316 do not act on their own, but do seem to be able to act collectively as a2 single unit. The individual instances of SCP-2316 are3 unrecognizable, and you do not recognize the bodies in the water.
    <br><br>
    SCP-2316 hosts a powerful cognitohazardous effect, causing those who have viewed SCP-2316, are aware of certain parts of its nature, or who were enrolled in the [COGNITOHAZARD REMOVED] [Automated Message: INVALID] to believe that the individual instances of SCP-2316 are human beings they recognize, typically from their childhood4.
    <br><br>
    Attempting to come into contact with SCP-2316 instances, by way of entering Lake ███████████ or touching an instance of SCP-2316, will cause other instances of SCP-2316 to appear. You do not recognize the bodies in the water. The additional instances only serve to reinforce and add to the strength of the cognitohazard5, compelling affected individuals into the lake. Individuals who enter the lake in this way are lost, and to date none have been recovered.
